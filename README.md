### Jpa practice project

# What is JPA?
The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification of Java. It is used to persist data between Java object and relational database. 
JPA acts as a bridge between object-oriented domain models and relational database systems.

As JPA is just a specification, it doesn't perform any operation by itself. It requires an implementation. So, ORM tools like Hibernate, 
TopLink and iBatis implements JPA specifications for data persistence.

# What is ORM?
Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a functionality which is used to develop and maintain a relationship between an object and relational database by 
mapping an object state to database column. It is capable to handle various database operations easily such as inserting, updating, deleting etc.
